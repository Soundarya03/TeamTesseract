# Sonnet generation through AI

This is a project that seeks to celebrate Ada Lovelace by bringing together two wildly different domains that moulded Ada's life - computer programs and poetry. And so, generating sonnets through AI. This is also our submission for the IEEE Ada Lovelace Hack, September 2020. 
The project consists of two major parts.
1. An ML model that can generate sonnets based on some input by the user (henceforth referred to as 'seed')
2. A simple, intuitive webpage that serves as an interface between the AI and the user.

## Installation

The webpage has been built using Flutter, and so to view it, you need to install it. The process has two main parts.

- Part 1 : Installing Flutter.

If this seems too confusing, or hard to follow, you can refer the following video -

This explains flutter and it's installation step by step, in great detail, and will make sure you have absolutely no trouble.

*Note*: Android Studio is not a necessity, because this project uses Flutter to build a webpage, not an mobile app. 

- Part 2 : Enabling Flutter for the web.

  - flutter channel master
  - flutter upgrade (to ensure you are on the latest version)
  - flutter doctor (to check if everything is fine)
  - flutter config --enable-web
  
  Again, in case of any problems, you may refer this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33kyEzDMTZU&t=44s from 00:00 to 01:00
  
 You are now good to go!
